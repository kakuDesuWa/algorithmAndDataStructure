    Notes:
        1. In Python arguments pass by reference to mutable variables, needn't return arr.
        2. Pass array size to function `even in Python can get array(list) len on runtime`.
        3. Replace for loop with while since Python for loop is not friendly to use index.

        4. Find the Right position; Move for space; Put it in.
